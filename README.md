# Deep_Learning_Electric_Power_Consumption_Forecasting
This project focuses on electric power consumption forecasting using deep learning. LSTM and GRU models are implemented to predict future energy usage from historical time series data, with feature scaling, sequence modeling, performance evaluation, and visual comparison of results.
